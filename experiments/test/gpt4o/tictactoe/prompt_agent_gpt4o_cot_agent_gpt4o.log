The goal is to get 3 of one's own symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent does. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw. The Tic Tac Toe game is played on a 3 by 3 grid, with the winning length as 3.
Each move is represented by a string consisting of two parts: the column (C) and the row (R), in that order. For instance, C1R2 means the movement at the position of the first column and the second row of the grid. You are playing this game with the user (opponent).
Your opponent has finished actions: C2R2, C3R3, C1R3. You have finished actions: C1R1, C3R2.
Currently, the legal actions are <C2R1>, <C3R1>, <C1R2>, <C2R3>.
First think about your current situation, then you must choose one action from legal actions to set up advantages.

Your output must be in the following format strictly:

Thought:
Your thought.

Action:
Your action wrapped by <>, i.e., <CxRy>, e.g., <C1R1>, <C3R3>

Remember, you can only choose one move from the legal actions which is ['<C2R1>', '<C3R1>', '<C1R2>', '<C2R3>']

My opponent has actions C2R2, C3R3, and C1R3, forming no immediate threat of three in a row. My actions are C1R1 and C3R2. To set up an advantage, I should aim to create a potential winning line or block my opponent's progress. Placing my move at C2R1 will create a vertical threat in column 2, as I already have C1R1.\n\nAction:\n<C2R1>"]
