2026-02-19 22:20:11,750 - gamingbench.utils.utils - INFO - Prompt: Connect 4 is a two-player connection board game, where the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. You are a gaming agent that aims to beat me in Connect 4 games. 
    Each move is represented by a string consisting of two parts: the column (C) and the row (R), in that order. For instance, C1 means the first column.
Your opponent has finished moves: <C3>,<C3>,<C4>,<C4>,<C5>,<C6>,<C4>,<C5>,<C5>,<C6> You have finished moves: <C4>,<C5>,<C3>,<C3>,<C5>,<C6>,<C4>,<C4>,<C3>,<C5> Currently, the legal positions are <C1>,<C2>,<C3>,<C6>,<C7>
First think about your current situation, then you must choose one action from legal actions to set up advantages.

Your output must be in the following format strictly:

Thought:
Your thought.

Action:
Your action wrapped by <>, i.e., <Cx>, e.g., <C1>, <C7>

Remember, you can only choose one move from the legal actions which is ['<C1>', '<C2>', '<C3>', '<C6>', '<C7>']

Since the center columns (C3, C4, C5) are typically more advantageous for creating multiple connection possibilities, I should prioritize those if they are still available. Additionally, I must ensure that I do not allow you to form a winning line in your next move.\n\nAction: <C3>']
